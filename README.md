# Summary
There are currently no registered medicines for the treatment of COVID-19, and few treatment results from clinical studies have been published. Therapy advice for COVID-19 can therefore not (yet) be scientifically substantiated well. Based on current data, this document discusses drug treatment options for patients with COVID-19 (infection with SARS –CoV-2). This mainly concerns patients who have been admitted because of serious symptoms of illness.

In vitro data are available for only three agents showing antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19: chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir.

A small patient series shows that hydroxychloroquine decreases respiratory viral load faster than standard care within 6 days. Chloroquine is also said to have clinical benefit with COVID-19. At an early or mild stage of infection, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may have clinical effects in hospitalized patients. Whether it is still effective at an advanced stage, that is to say at ARDS, is unknown.

Remdesivir is an intravenous antiviral, which has not yet been registered, so that both effectiveness and safety are unknown. In vitro activity against beta-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV (type 1), MERS-CoV and also SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated.

Lopinavir / ritonavir does not appear to be pharmacologically the first choice, but has been shown to be active in SARS-CoV (type 1) at early initiation of therapy when results were compared to historical controls. This was unclear with SARS-CoV-2. Following the recently published open label RCT, this no longer seems to be a valid alternative to the other products. However, in the predominantly critically ill patient population, in the only RCT at this time, there are trends in decrease in mortality and hospital stay in ICU and department, but these are not statistically significant. At the most, this might argue in favor of using this at a relatively early stage of infection before the patient arrives at the ICU.

Because no proven therapeutic effect has been established for all of these agents in COVID-19, no targeted drug therapy advice can be given until more clinical data become available. Optimal supportive care is therefore the most important. If there were room, it is likely that administration to patients admitted for pneumonia before the occurrence of serious complications is most favorable. Uniform input of patient data into standardised databases (e.g. ISARIC) is recommended so that results of treatment strategies can be compared.

Administration of off-label agents and / or experimental therapy requires _informed consent from the patient_.

In case of deterioration under initial therapy or very severe presentation (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation), remdesivir (i.v. 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg per day for 9 days, or pediatric dose) may be administered or added to (hydroxy) chloroquine . Exclusion criteria have currently been formulated by the supplier (Gilead): multi-organ failure, use of vasopressors, ALAT> 5 x ULN, creatine clearance <30 ml / min, dialysis or CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration). The application process for this compassionate use program at the supplier takes time and the drug must come from abroad. There may be no national stock of this unregistered substance. Side effects of remdesivir are not known, so use is now proposed as "rescue" therapy. Treatment with ribavirin, oseltamivir or interferon is not meaningful based on available efficacy and safety data.

## Introduction
There are no registered drugs for coronavirus infections at the time of this publication (March 20, 2020). However, there are in vitro data and small studies have attempted to treat patients with an infection with SARS-CoV (type 1) and MERS-CoV with a number of antivirals on an experimental basis. The results provide only moderate evidence for therapeutic advice in these coronavirus infections, due to small numbers, variable drug combinations, patient group heterogeneity, and reported outcomes. It is not yet clear whether these results will be extended to COVID-19. This overview summarizes the available data of drug options that may be administered in addition to optimal supportive care1. There is an interaction checker, where it can be seen whether medication that the patient uses can go together with off-label therapeutic medicines http://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/.

### Chloroquine
Chloroquine is used in the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria and as an immune modulator in rheumatoid arthritis and Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE).

In multiple infections by (unrelated) viruses, chloroquine inhibits pH-dependent virus replication steps in vitro, such as with Zika2. However, in vivo data is lacking. With SARS-CoV (type 1) chloroquine was known to inhibit virus replication in vitro3. Fusion inhibition seems to occur, but possibly also inhibition further down the virus replication. In addition, chloroquine has immune modulatory properties, which can potentially influence the course of the disease. With SARS-CoV-2 chloroquine shows inhibition of virus replication at doses that can be reached in humans (EC50 = 1.13 µM) 4. This concentration is 360 ng / ml when converted, which cannot be achieved with a standard 600 mg loading dose in plasma5. It is unclear whether adequate concentrations are reached at the site of infection and / or extra-intracellular, but it is possible because of the large volume of distribution of chloroquine. Therefore, a lower loading dose is not recommended. The various published Chinese studies mention concentrations of either 400 mg once daily or 500 mg twice daily6. It is important that the dosage in the Netherlands is expressed as "base" and not as "phosphate". In the literature, dosages are also given in phosphate; 500 mg of chloroquine phosphate is equivalent to 300 mg of chloroquine base. It is unclear from the Chinese trials which formulation is used. The tablets available in the Netherlands (A-CQ 100 mg) contain 100 mg chloroquine base. The maximum dose of 600 mg loading dose in malaria treatment is also based on the base. With COVID-19 the comparable loading dose of 600 mg base (6 tablets) was chosen, followed by further treatment after 12 hours with 300 mg base, followed by 4 days twice daily 300 mg.
Treatment at this dose for longer than 5 days will lead to even higher plasma levels and further tissue accumulation, given the long half-life of chloroquine. Its antiviral effect is likely to be limited because elimination is slow. The half-life is one month. If treatment is still going on after day 5, then once a day 300 mg is sufficient to keep the tissue concentrations from rising any further.

In renal insufficiency and / or hemodialysis / CVVH, it is not advisable to treat for longer than 5 days, as this delays the elimination even more.

Prolongation of therapy should be accompanied by ECG monitoring of the QT interval and based on viral clearance. Discontinuation is advised for clinically significant QT prolongation and / or disappearance of virus in sputum / nasal or throat swabs.

Child dose: loading 10 mg / kg chloroquine base, followed by 5 mg / kg as second dose on day 1, then twice daily 5 mg / kg base on day 2 to day 5.

Chloroquine 300 mg twice daily for 5 days with a single 600 mg loading dose now appears to be a real therapeutic option in view of the safety in adults and children and the known side effect pattern. In known QT prolongation or viral myocarditis, lopinavir / ritonavir or remdesivir may be more likely to be decided. This short duration of treatment reduces the risk of eye defects.

Only when positive treatment results have been published can it be decided to use in an early stage of the disease before serious lung abnormalities or oxygenation disorders have occurred. The latter would be preferable in subjects with expected severe course, such as immunocompromised patients, older people over 70 with high mortality rates, and subjects with cardiovascular comorbidity7,8.

### Hydroxychloroquine
Hydroxychloroquine has a similar molecular structure to chloroquine. A hydroxyethyl group was added to chloroquine to reduce toxicity. It is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Q fever and lupus erythematosus.

Hydroxychloroquine shows in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-29, with better antiviral activity than chloroquine at a lower concentration. The suggested dose is 2x 400mg hydroxychloroquine sulfate on day 1, then 2x 200mg hydroxychloroquine sulfate on days 2-5 based on pharmacokinetic simulations, which predict adequate lung concentration. In a small patient series in an uncontrolled study in France, 26 enrolled patients were treated 4 days (range 1-10 days) after onset of symptoms with hydroxychloroquine 3 times 200 mg for 10 days and compared to 16 controls10. With hydroxychloroquine, 70% of patients were PCR negative after 6 days, compared to 12.5% in controls. Six patients also received azithromycin for an additional 5 days due to the desire to prevent a bacterial superinfection, while 2/6 had only identified an upper respiratory tract infection in COVID-19 as a reason for hospitalisation. In these 6 subjects, the nasopharyngeal swabs were PCR negative after 6 days. Administration of hydrochloroquine did not prevent 3/26 from having to be admitted to the ICU and another person dying.

### Remdesivir
The nucleoside analogous inhibitor (supplier: Gilead) has activity against Ebola and corona viruses, among others. Activity against ebola has been demonstrated in vitro and in monkeys, so that remdesivir was one of the four arms in the PALM Trial in Democratic Republic of Congo11. The adult dose was a single 200 mg intravenous (i.v.) loading dose followed by 100 mg i.v. per day. The pediatric dose (<40 kg body weight) is a loading dose of 5 mg / kg IV. on day 1, followed by 2.5 mg / kg once a day for 9 days. Mortality was higher when using remdesivir compared to other monoclonal antibody therapy. Since no placebo arm was included, it is unknown whether there is any therapeutic effect in humans at all at this dose of remdesivir.

In vitro studies with human lung cell lines showed activity against SARS and MERS-CoV12. MERS-CoV has demonstrated antiviral activity in a mouse model: both prophylactically and 24 hours after infection, viral load has been shown to decrease by 2 or more logs on days 4-5 post infection and to show clinical improvement13.
In SARS-CoV-2, it has recently become clear in vitro that remdesivir already has antiviral activity at low concentrations (EC50 = 0.77 µM) 4.

Safety data from phase 1 research has not yet been published. So while there are indications of viral inhibition, it is not yet clear whether that can be achieved in humans and which safety risks arise. Trials in China are being set up. The recommended dose is the same as for Ebola. Combination therapy with other anti-COVID-19 agents is not permitted.

### Azitromycine
Azithromycin has extensive experience in the treatment of various lung diseases. There may be antiviral properties, but in MERS-CoV, the use of macrolides was not associated with reduction in mortality and decrease in viral load14.

In a small patient series in a non-randomized study, azithromycin was added to treatment with hydroxychloroquine to treat bacterial superinfections in 6 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with relatively mild clinical symptoms10. Azithromycin dosage was 500mg on day 1 and then 250mg on days 2-5. In these 6 patients, the nasopharyngeal swabs were PCR negative after 5 days (with 1 rebound at a later time). Theoretically, infectivity would therefore decrease more quickly. However, it is currently not clear whether the clinical outcome will also improve.

Using azithromycin as an antiviral based on the findings of 6 patients is too premature. There may be a place for use as an immune modulator as known from pediatrics15. The combination of azithromycin and (hydroxy-) chloroquine is not recommended due to the increased risks of arrhythmias.

### Lopinavir/ritonavir
There extensive experience with the  HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir / ritonavir in the use for HIV treatment. Because there are now other HIV medicines that can be given less frequently, because there are many interactions between these medicines and gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea) are a frequent side effect during long-term use, lopinavir / ritonavir is prescribed less frequently. This drug combination also exists in a drinkable form that is mainly used in children because of the ease of administration. Combination therapy with chloroquine (see below) may increase the risk of side effects due to an increased concentration of chloroquine. Based on current experience, combination therapy is not recommended. In particular, the risk of QT interval prolongation or cardiotoxicity appears to occur more frequently. When combined with other medications, it is possible to verify interactions through the University of Liverpool website (http://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/).

_MERS-CoV_:
Results from in vitro studies on lopinavir antiviral activity against MERS-CoV are inconclusive, as both inhibitory activity and absent activity were reported16,17.
Animal models: lopinavir plus interferon alfa resulted in weight loss reduction, clinical improvement, lower viral titers in MERS-CoV infected brush monkeys (marmosets) 18. In a mouse model, lopinavir / ritonavir-interferon beta did improve lung function upon infection, but did not inhibit virus replication13. In this study, remdesivir had better lung abnormalities and viral inhibition outcomes.
Clinical data:
In South Korea, a case was treated with lopinavir / ritonavir in combination with ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a, surviving19.
In Greece, a case was treated with lopinavir / ritonavir, interferon and ribavirin, which started on day 13 of illness. Despite plasma negative MERS-CoV 2 days after starting treatment, virus RNA remained in the airways for 4 weeks and the subject died20.
During the outbreak in South Korea, 14 patients were treated with pegylated interferon alfa, ribavirin and lopinavir / ritonavir, but data on effect are missing21.
Lopinavir / ritonavir plus interferon beta-1b is now used in a prospective study of treatment for MERS-CoV (MIRACLE trial NCT02845843) 22. The dose used is:
Lopinavir / Ritonavir 400 mg + 100 mg twice daily for 14 days, and
Interferon beta-1b 0.25 mg subcutaneously every other day for 14 days. 

_SARS-CoV (type 1)_:The in vitro data are inconsistent with SARS-CoV (type 1), as in 3 studies, virus inhibition is sometimes observed and sometimes not23. Clinical data have also been obtained, in which this agent was given in combination with other agents:
The combination of lopinavir / ritonavir twice daily 400/100 mg plus ribavirin and high dose corticosteroids has been used in 41 patients with SARS, with fewer ARDS and / or death occurred compared to 111 historical controls that were treated with ribavirin plus high dose corticosteroids, 21 days after onset of symptoms (2.4% vs 28.8%, p = 0.001) 24.
A retrospective study in Hong Kong found that administration of lopinavir / ritonavir 2 dd 400/100 mg for 10-14 days at day 5.5 (median) after onset of symptoms along with ribavirin in confirmed diagnosis of SARS resulted in a 2.3% mortality in the 44 patients treated in this way. This was 15.6% in 634 matched controls from the database that received ribavirin and / or corticosteroids alone. When lopinavir / ritonavir was added as 'rescue' therapy in clinical worsening at Day 18 (median) after onset of symptoms, mortality was 12.9% in the 31 patients treated and 14.0% in patients who had ribavirin and corticosteroids alone25 .

_SARS-CoV-2_:In vitro data for lopinavir / ritonavir are currently lacking. The HIV protease inhibited by lopinavir / ritonavir is biochemically incompatible with the coronavirus protease26. The pharmacological support for its use is therefore not strong, and also the only unblinded RCT now done in 99 patients with COVID-19 compared with 100 patients (initiation of treatment median 13 days (IQR 11-16) after onset symptoms) receiving standard care does not show significant clinical benefit27:
Virologic clearance up to day 28 was not different in either arm.
Day 28 mortality was not significantly different between the two arms: 19/99 patients with lopinavir / ritonavir (19.2%) versus 25/100 (25.0%) (95% CI, −17.3 - 5.7), with mortality in the lopinavir / ritonavir arm was 19% in the first 12 days since onset of symptoms and 19.3% after 12 days.
On day 7 of admission after randomization, there was no difference in numbers undergoing mechanical ventilation or ECMO: 6/99 versus 4/100, nor on day 14: 3/99 versus 5/100. Survivors remained shorter in ICU using lopinavir / ritonavir, median 9 versus 11 days. The duration of ventilation, 4 versus 5 days and duration of hospital stay 14 versus 16 days were shorter, but that was also not statistically significant.
A post hoc analysis (patients who died before the first gift of lopinavir / ritonavir was excluded) in this study suggests that early treatment may make a difference (here: <12d post onset of symptoms): median time to clinical recovery: 16 d (vs. 17d; -1d) and less mortality (19% vs. 27.1%; absolute - 8.1%). It is unclear whether lopinavir / ritonavir is beneficial in earlier pneumonia and what the clinical criteria for administration should be.

Based on these findings, lopinavir / ritonavir no longer appears to be a valid alternative to the other agents


It is unknown whether the addition of ribavirin or interferon to lopinavir / ritonavir is necessary because these two agents individually do not consistently contribute to improvement of beta-coronaviruses infection.

Note: The editorial emphasizes that selective inhibition of cytokines during sepsis or ARDS has risks, such as increasing susceptibility to bacterial infections or reactivation of viral infections.

# Specific immunomodulatory treatment (“Biologicals”)
_Summary_
The evaluation of “biologicals” (eg IL-1β-RA / anakinra, anti-IL-6 / tocilizumab) is managed by the NVIC and kept as up to date as possible. Contrary to previous reports, the NVIC advises that the experimental biologicals should not be prescribed outside a trial context. The scientific studies on “biologicals” and COVID-19 follow each other in rapid succession. As soon as there are new publications in this area, they will be taken into account in the next update of our advice. The text below therefore describes the currently available data and is not treatment advice.

_Introduction_
A cytokine profile resembling secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphocytic Histiocytosis (HLH), also known as Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS), occurs in a subgroup of Covid-19 patients [Huang, 2020]. In addition to the "cytokine storm", ferritin is greatly increased during MAS. In a retrospective analysis to identify predictors of death in Covid-19 patients, elevated IL-6 and ferritin were relevant covariates [Ruan, 2020], suggesting that hyperinflammation increases the risk of death. However, the diagnosis of MAS can be difficult, where the Hscore can be used(https://www.mdcalc.com/hscore-reactive-hemophagocytic-syndrome), which has a high sensitivity and specificity for this syndrome in patients with autoimmune diseases. Clinical evidence includes: fever, hepato and splenomegaly, pancytopenia, elevated triglycerides and ferritin, decreased fibrinogen, and hepatic impairment.
Several specific anti-cytokine therapies may be useful in patients with "cytokine storm syndrome" after or during a virus infection. Examples are drugs targeting Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-1.

_Anti-IL-6_
IL-6 concentrations are increased in Covid-19 patients and the inflammation is related to lung damage. Several monoclonal antibodies to IL-6 (receptor) have been registered for rheumatic diseases. Tocilizumab has been used in patients with Covid-19 in China, but in addition to case series involving several dozen patients, no data is currently available from randomized studies. The description of clinical improvement in a few dozen patients who received treatment with an IL-6 antibody, among other things, is of no value without comparing it with the course in a control group. Two Chinese studies are currently being conducted (150 patients: ChiCTR2000030894, 188 patients: ChiCTR2000029765) and a phase 2-3 study (400 patients with sarilumab) will start in April 2020.

_IL-1β-RA/anakinra_
Anakinra is an IL-1-beta receptor antagonist. This agent has been studied in patients with bacterial sepsis [Opal, 1997]. Only in a post-hoc analysis in the subgroup of bacterial sepsis patients with hepatic impairment and signs of diffuse intravascular coagulation expressing MAS (6% of total group) was a beneficial effect on survival seen [Shakoory, 2016]. In a study with lung epithelial cells infected with rat-specific Corona viruses, chemokine expression was less after anakinra exposure. No studies have been done in Covid-19 patients.

If you still consider prescribing one of these means, if so desired, consult an expert in your own hospital. If desired, you can also consult with Jeroen Schouten / Frank van de Veerdonk or Mihai Netea in Radboudumc (jeroen.schouten@radboudumc.nl)

# Other antivirals
### Ribavirine
Ribavirin tablets have been used in combination with interferon alfa in the treatment of hepatitis C, but have been replaced by more effective and safer antivirals given the side effects pattern (haemolytic anemia, bone marrow depression).
Ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b decreased viral load in rhesus monkeys in MERS-CoV and showed partial effect in prevention of pneumonia compared to untreated control monkeys28. In humans, this effect has not been consistently demonstrated in MERS-CoV in multiple studies:
- In a retrospective cohort study in intensive care, treatment of 144 patients with ribavirin plus / minus interferon compared to 205 patients without antiviral treatment did not improve mortality at day 90: mortality 73.6% and 61.5%, respectively (p = 0.02) 29 . Also, there was no faster viral RNA clearance with ribavirin plus or minus interferon.
- In a retrospective study in 51 patients, where mortality was 37%, 19/51 patients (37.5%) received ribavirin, interferon beta 23/51 (45.1%), or interferon alfa 8/51 (15.7%). Fifteen of the 19 received a combination of ribavirin and an interferon. 8/51 (15.7%) also received mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), 7 of which in combination with interferon beta. In the multivariate analysis, no form of antiviral treatment was found to be associated with survival, although all patients receiving MMF survived30.
- Five patients treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin at the time of their ventilation all died31.
- Twenty patients received ribavirin for 8-10 days and subcutaneously pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 μg weekly for two weeks). Day 28 mortality was not significantly different in this group (70%) versus that in 24 untreated patients (83%) 32.
- Mortality in 13 patients receiving ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2a was 85% (11/13), while it was 64% (7/11) in patients receiving ribavirin with IFN-β-1a (p = 0.24) 33.
The dose of ribavirin used which would inhibit replication of MERS-CoV leads to frequent adverse events34. In addition, the required concentration leading to inhibition of virus replication in vitro cannot be achieved with administration in humans16,34.

The current SARS-CoV-2 has determined an EC50, where very high concentrations were required for virus inhibition4. Ribavirin is therefore not considered an option for the treatment of COVID-19.

### Interferon
Interferons are registered as an antiviral or immune modulator:

* Interferon alfa has been used in the treatment of hepatitis B and C and acts as an antiviral. Given the subcutaneous administration and strong side effects pattern (flu-like complaints, bone marrow suppression, depression) it has been abandoned and replaced by more effective and safer oral antivirals.
* Interferon beta-1b is registered for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and acts as an immune modulator.
* Interferon γ is produced by lymphocytes and activates phagocytes. It has been registered for chronic granulomatous disease and malignant osteopetrosis.

In vitro studies show that interferon beta on monkey cells is effective against MERS-CoV16,34. It was found that IFN-β-1b gave the most replication inhibition, with better bioavailability than IFN-α-2a, IFN-α-2b or IFN-β-1a. However, in a mouse model, interferon beta was not found to inhibit MERS-CoV virus replication13. This was also evident from other research, which showed that MERS-CoV is more sensitive to IFN-α, at least much more than SARS-CoV (type 1) 35. The retrospective studies - mentioned with ribavirin, see above - showed that IFN-α-2a, IFN-α-2b or IFN-β-1a in combination with ribavirin (which therefore itself has little antiviral activity at these doses in humans) does not provide a clear benefit in patients with MERS-CoV. There is a lot of difference between patients in the time of illness when they were given these medicines, which makes interpretation difficult. 

These inconclusive findings led to a recommendation to investigate this prospectively at least once in MERS-CoV, using TNF-β-1b in addition to lopinavir / ritonavir22. Whether this recommendation should be extended to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection - a related beta-coronavirus but with a lower mortality - is unclear and debatable.

### Favipiravir:
The viral polymerase inhibitor favipiravir is only registered in Japan for the treatment of influenza. Clinical studies to support this registration have still not been published. As an antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2, it does not appear to be an option, as virus inhibition can only be achieved at high concentrations4. The question is whether such concentrations can be achieved in humans, or whether this will be ineffective - just as when it was studied as an Ebola treatment36. However, it is currently being investigated in China and Japan as a therapeutic agent.

### Monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma:
Limited studies with convalescent plasma in SARS-CoV (type 1) do show possible effect with better survival37,38. In MERS-CoV, few patients develop sufficiently high antibody concentrations that could be used as therapy in other patients39. It is unknown whether antibodies to the other coronaviruses, the standard cold viruses, have cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, administration of IVIG in the Netherlands - which contains standard antibodies against circulating coronaviruses - is unlikely to make sense in patients with hypogammaglobulinaemia or other serious immune disorders who develop SARS-CoV-2 infection. Higher concentrations of monoclonal antibodies may achieve therapeutic effects, but these are not yet available for this virus40.

### Oseltamivir:
This neuraminidase inhibitor used in influenza treatment is not useful in coronaviruses because it has no pharmacological target.

### Darunavir
There is no published data supporting the use of the other HIV protease inhibitor darunavir. The only report from the company is that the doses used in HIV treatment cannot be expected to be virus inhibiting and that darunavir / cobicistat was not effective in an RCT in Shanghai https://www.janssen.com/lack-evidence-support-use-darunavir-based-treatments-sars-cov-2. So Darunavir is not a therapeutic option.
 
# Other drugs:
Dozens of trials are underway in China with many different agents, including baloxavir, umifenovir (an anti-viral registered only in Russia), other HIV protease inhibitors, nitazoxanide (an anti-parasitic agent) and traditional Chinese medicines. These are not discussed here, as no in vitro data or clinical efficacy are known and / or safety has not been investigated.

### Immunosuppressiva:
Mycophenolate mofetil, a purine synthesis inhibitor, used in immunosuppressant for renal transplantation and Crohn's disease, appears to show antiviral effect in vivo in MERS-CoV30. Alisporivir, a cyclophilin inhibitor similar to cyclosporine, also shows antiviral effect in vitro41. Whether that means that people who take these drugs as medicines in connection with transplantation or intestinal disease are thereby protected against coronaviruses is still unknown.

### Corticosteroïden:
Corticosteroids were frequently prescribed in SARS and MERS-CoV in the hope that they could prevent immune-mediated damage. Since this can also lead to an increase in viral replication, there is much doubt about its use as a treatment42. In studies in Intensive Care (IC) patients with MERS-CoV, corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 200-400 mg per day) prolong viral secretion22.

Corticosteroids are often prescribed in critically ill IC patients, but this extends the period of possible nosocomial transmission risks. In addition, there is little evidence that mortality decreases in SARS from corticosteroids; it is more likely that there are only negative effects23.

In a retrospective analysis of admitted SARS-CoV-2 patients in Wuang, China, it was found that within the group of patients who developed ARDS, mortality was lower in the group with methylprednisolone than without 43. In SARS-CoV-2 patients, administration of Corticosteroids may therefore be beneficial in patients who develop ARDS. In a general sense, three different meta-analyses on the use of corticosteroids in ARDS point towards improved outcomes with corticosteroids44-46. In influenza-associated ARDS, there is evidence of increased mortality47.

Thus, the use of corticosteroids is not a therapeutic option for the elimination of this viral infection in infected subjects with a moderate infection, but possibly only in decreasing severity of ARDS / in the treatment of early fibrosing ARDS.

The use of corticosteroids in lower doses, e.g. 1-2 dd 40 mg prednisolone, as in an exacerbation of COPD, does not seem to lead to more serious complications immediately in a small observational study of 11 patients48.

### ACE remmers / AT II antagonisten
No studies have shown a correlation between the use of ACE inhibitors / ATII antagonists and the upregulation of ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2). A few studies in animal models showed that ACE inhibitors and AT-II antagonists can upregulate ACE-2 49-51, while other animal studies did not show this 52.53. The two studies done in humans have shown no increase or decrease in free ACE-2 in blood plasma. It is also not clear whether an increased ACE-2 really leads to more infection of the coronavirus in, for example, the lungs54,55.
There is no scientific evidence that ACE inhibitors or ATII antagonists exacerbate infection with COVID-19. Both EMA (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-gives-advice-use-non-steroidal-anti-inflammatories-covid-19) as all international scientific associations in the field of cardiovascular diseases (http://www.nephjc.com/news/covidace2), such as The International Society of Hypertension, The European Society of Hypertension and The European Society of Cardiology, based on current findings, advise that continuation of ACE inhibitors and AT-II antagonists should NOT be discontinued or switched to another antihypertensive agent.

### NSAID’s (ibuprofen)
There is currently insufficient evidence that the use of NSAIDs, for pain or fever associated with COVID-19 infection, adversely affects course and recovery. This does not alter the fact that paracetamol is always and remains first choice for the treatment of symptoms. Patients using NSAIDs for rheumatism, for example, should not stop using this NSAID.
The rumor that NSAIDs adversely affect the course of a coronavirus (see various social media posts) is based on a Lancet correspondence56. Here it is described that ibuprofen can increase ACE-2. This ACE-2 uses the coronavirus to enter the human host cell. Unfortunately, the substantiation, and / or a reference, for this hypothesis assumption that ibuprofen increases ACE2 is not given. Also, this Lancet article only talks about ibuprofen and not about NSAIDs in totality56.
The hypothesis is then that because of the extra ACE2, the coronavirus has more targets to penetrate the host cell, thus aggravating infection. However, the conflicting hypothesis is that because there is more ACE2, precisely by engaging ACE2 on AT2R, the inflammations are inhibited so that less lung damage would occur 57.
More research is needed to support these hypotheses.

# Advice
Pending the results of prospective studies, it may now be considered to add chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir to the optimal supportive care for a serious infection.

The assessment of severity is mainly based on clinical criteria. Radiological examinations often showed abnormalities in even mild cases, so that these criteria cannot be taken as a measure of seriousness. Microbiological criteria may be included, such as viral load in sputum, although it may fluctuate during the course. Clinical criteria now used in severe COVID-19 pneumonia are: respiratory rate ≥ 30 / min; SaO2 ≤ 93% at rest; or PaO2 / FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kpa).

It is now recommended to start known and available substances only in patients with extra oxygen demand, because in mild cases the course of disease without medication appears to be favorable and there may even only be toxicity / side effects if these substances appear to be ineffective. Thus, preference is given to monotherapy with either chloroquine or lopinavir / ritonavir without high doses of corticosteroids, where monitoring of viral load in nasal and throat swabs and sputum is recommended. In the absence of antiviral effect after a few days in combination with clinical deterioration, adjustment of the medication is indicated. A combination of both drugs or a combination of these drugs with remdesivir seems to be best recommended. Combinations lead to an increased risk of adverse reactions due to interactions, especially when lopinavir / ritonavir is combined with either other agent. Check http://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/ for this. It is not known whether this occurs with remdesivir, that is not stated on this website. Careful monitoring of any harmful effects is therefore recommended.

### Chloroquine
Chloroquine has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and is likely to achieve antiviral activity in the standard dose, but clinical data are still lacking. This medicine is also available in the Netherlands and can be administered orally. This can be administered in children> 10 kg and adults. There is limited experience with use during pregnancy. Contraindications are known QT time extension before or at diagnosis of COVID and in viral myocarditis due to known cardiotoxicity of chloroquine. There may be an increased risk of hemolysis with G6PD deficiency, so that an alternative could be chosen for a known, serious, known G6PD deficiency.
Recommended dosage: loading dose of 600 mg of chloroquine base (6 tablets A-CQ 100 mg) followed by 300 mg after 12 hours on the same day (day 1), then twice a day at 300 mg per os for 5 days. Nothing is known about the usefulness of longer dosing, but dose reduction to 1 dd 300 mg is then recommended. The pediatric dose is based on a single 10 mg / kg loading dose, followed after 12 hours by 5 mg / kg on day 1 and then 5 mg / kg twice daily on days 2-5. ECG monitoring and in-use glucose measurements are recommended due to side effects of cardiotoxicity and hypoglycemia.

### Hydroxychloroquine
Hydroxychloroquine has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and can achieve antiviral activity in the standard dose. This medicine is available in the Netherlands and can be administered orally. This can be administered in children> 1 month and adults. Contraindications are known QT time extension before or at diagnosis of COVID and in viral myocarditis due to known cardiotoxicity of hydroxychloroquine.
Recommended dosage: 2x 400mg hydroxychloroquine sulfate on day 1, then 2x 200mg hydroxychloroquine sulfate for 4 days. The pediatric dose for children from 1 month to 18 years of age and <60 kg is 2 x 6.5 mg / kg on day 1 (maximum 400 mg / dose) followed by 3.5 mg / kg twice daily on days 2 to 5 and for children> 60 kg 400 mg twice a day on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice a day on days 2 to 5.
Note: For patients taking immunosuppressive agents, a marked increase in the levels of cyclosporine, sirolimus, everolimus and tacrimolus should be taken into account when starting (hydroxy-) chloroquine. It is recommended to reduce the dose and to check the levels of the relevant products in the short term, in consultation with the hospital pharmacy. I.v.m. the long half-life of (hydroxy-) chloroquine, this effect will also be clinically relevant 2 weeks after discontinuation and deserves special attention.
 
**Lopinavir/ritonavir** does not appear to be pharmacologically the first choice, but has been shown to be active in SARS-CoV (type 1) at early initiation of therapy when results were compared with historical controls. This was unclear with SARS-CoV-2. Following the recently published open label RCT, this no longer seems to be a valid alternative to the other products.
Recommended dose is 400/100 mg per os twice a day for 10-14 days. Drug interactions and diarrhea are a known side effects of this drug.

**Remdesivir** is an experimental alternative seen in vitro data in SARS-CoV-2 and effect in animal studies of therapeutic use in MERS-CoV. There is only an intravenous formulation of it. However, dosage, duration of treatment and side effects in humans are unknown. There is one preliminary WHO-onderzoeksprotocol in which one wants to compare this medicine with placebo, in which use is not recommended in children, liver insufficiency (AST or ALT> 5 x increased above ULN), clearance <30 ml / min and pregnancy.

The request to receive brake desivir through compassionate use is through an online Gilead portal: https://rdvcu.gilead.com.
Recommended dose is 200 mg intravenously on Day 1, followed by 100 mg for 9 days. The pediatric dose (<40 kg body weight) is a loading dose of 5 mg / kg IV. on day 1, followed by 2.5 mg / kg once a day for 9 days.

**Other**: Use of ribavirin, interferon, favipiravir or oseltamivir are not pharmacologically options due to the lack of research data supporting effectiveness and / or safety in COVID-19.
 
# Conclusion
*Patients with mild symptoms*: in view of the mild course in the majority of infected persons, it is now recommended not to start with agents whose efficacy has not yet been demonstrated in mild complaints of proven COVID-19.
*Seriously ill patients*: In the case of respiratory complaints and oxygen demand, consideration can be given to starting with one of the three drugs, because death mainly occurs in 'critical cases' (respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, septic shock) and not in mild or serious complaints8. Mortality was especially high in elderly patients over 70 years of age, so therapy could be decided earlier. In accordance with influenza infection, cardiovascular and lung patients (COPD) are considered to be at risk for unfavorable course. Diabetes is not a known risk factor for respiratory infections and therefore does not lower the threshold for using off-label agents for a viral respiratory infection. A physician makes the assessment on the basis of the severity of the condition, the simultaneous use of other medications in which interaction can be expected and preexistent heart problems (especially QT prolongation) or can be started with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. With (relative) contraindication for both or lack of clinical improvement after initiation of either, remdesivir may be selected as 'rescue' therapy. At initial presentation with severe pneumonia, combination therapy with remdesivir can be chosen.
*Patients with immune disorders or use of immunosuppressants*: Little is known about a more serious course in this vulnerable patient category, but according to influenza infections there may be an increased risk of viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial infection here. Fever can be absent from infection with some medications. Early testing for respiratory infections now seems to be the best strategy. First of all if the patient meets the case definition, but also at a high incidence in the Netherlands or with household contacts. Diagnosis of pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients is also important. Treatment before the onset of oxygen demand can then be considered in case of a proven infection of the patient and the development of dyspnea. Prophylactic use without proven COVID-19 or already in mild complaints with proven COVID-19 is now too early to advise due to missing data on the therapeutic effect. Interaction of lopinavir / ritonavir and immunosuppressants (such as tacrolimus, check https://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/) is a risk in some patients. Chloroquine and / or remdesivir would then be a preferred option.
